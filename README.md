# Journey-to-Mars
In this project, i built a a simple game in Python using Pygame package, called Journey to Mars. The aim of the game is to move from side to side and up and down in order to avoid meteors that fall from the sky, to reach a score as high as possible. As time goes on, the speed of the meteors increases.
